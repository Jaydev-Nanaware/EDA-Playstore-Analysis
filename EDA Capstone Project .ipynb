We found that categories such as GAME, SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION, and TOOL have the highest amount of installs, ratings, and reviews, while users from GAME and FAMILY categories have a high trend of using paid apps. Additionally, we found out that the majority of apps in the Play Store are free and have no age restrictions.\n","4.The frequency is destributed in parabolic manner and is highly dense at 4.3\n","5.Communication, tool, productivity, social and  photography are the top genres having highest number of installs.\n","6.Rating shows infinitismal amount of difference in average rating among genres i.e. average rating of all genre does not vary much.\n","7.There are negligible paid apps comparing to free ones in each category.\n","8.Comparing to the number of paid apps in each category, they have tremendously high number of installs while games, communication and family have highest number of installs for both paid and free apps.\n","9.Medical, finance, family and lifestyle categories have the most expensive apps and have very low number of installs. \n","10.The relation of installs and size of application negative.\n","11.The positive sentiment are overall high for each category and it contribute overall 2/3rd of total while neutral sentimments hold 1/5th of overall sentiments and negative sentiments hold 1/7th of overall market sentiments.\n","12.Rating have positive realtion with review, review have strongest positive realtion with installs, size have positive relations with except installs.\n","\n","Moreover, it can be concluded that apps with a high rating are more likely to have a high amount of reviews and user installs, with apps from the categories of SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION, and GAME being the most popular. In terms of app size and price, most apps with good ratings are not necessarily big in size or expensive. Lastly, we found that the top five most expensive apps in the store are mostly from the FINANCE and LIFESTYLE categories, which are not as popular as the categories of GAME, SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION, and TOOL.\n","\n","Overall, these insights can provide valuable information to developers looking to capture the Android market and drive their app-making businesses to success. By focusing on creating high-quality apps that are entertaining or assistive, developers can increase their chances of success in the competitive Play Store market."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Hurrah!
